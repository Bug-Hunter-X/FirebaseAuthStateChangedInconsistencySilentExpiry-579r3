The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger when a user's session expires silently due to token expiration or network issues. This can lead to the app remaining in an inconsistent state, thinking the user is still authenticated while they are actually logged out.  This is particularly problematic when the app relies on the user's authentication state to render UI elements or access data.  The listener may never fire the 'unauthenticated' state if the token simply expires, leaving the app unaware.
