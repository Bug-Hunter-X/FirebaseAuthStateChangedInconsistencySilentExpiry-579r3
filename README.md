# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in Firebase authentication. The `onAuthStateChanged` listener may fail to reflect the user's actual authentication status when a session expires silently. This usually happens due to token expiration or transient network issues.

The provided `authBug.js` file shows how an application might be impacted. The solution is provided in `authBugSolution.js`.  This solution implements additional checks to periodically verify the user's session with Firebase, making the authentication status more resilient.
